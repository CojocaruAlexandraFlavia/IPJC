## Game Description - Student in Trouble üö∂üèªüèÉüèªüö∂üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüèÉüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

*(Inspiration - Santa Claus in trouble)*

Our Game is named *Student in Trouble* and it is composed of multiple levels that the player has to finish in order to achieve points (*knowledge* as it is mentioned in the game). The player's character is a student that jumps on platforms which look like desks, has to gather all the homework (*knowledge points*) and has to avoid *evil books* that may try to kill him.  
The player has to move the character with the *up-down-right-left arrows* and jump from one platform to another, until he reaches the end of the level. In order for the player to go to the next level, he has to collect all the *knowledge points*. If he tries to go to the next level without collecting all of them, he needs to go back and do it. After he collects all the points, the player is required to solve a minigame and only after that he passes to the next level.

## Minigames

During the game, there are three minigames that are showing up between levels. You have to complete each minigame to advance in the game. The minigames have a board (7x7, 9x9 and 15x15). You have to align at least 3 dots horizontally or vertically, making them disappear and, with each move, achieving a number of points. The bigger the board, the bigger the score goal.
